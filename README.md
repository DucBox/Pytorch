# Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch - IBM Course Completion

## Introduction

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources from the "Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch" course offered by IBM on Coursera. This course covers the fundamentals of deep learning and provides hands-on experience with building and training neural networks using PyTorch.

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of deep neural networks and PyTorch:

1. **Introduction to PyTorch**
    - Overview of PyTorch framework
    - Key features and benefits
    - Installation and setup
  
2. **Basic Models**
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic/Softmax Regression

3. **Basic Neural Networks**
    - Perceptrons and activation functions
    - Forward and backward propagation
    - Building and training simple neural networks

4. **Deep Neural Networks**
    - Architectures of deep neural networks
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    - Training deep neural networks

5. **Data Processing with PyTorch**
    - Preparing datasets for training
    - Data augmentation and preprocessing
    - Utilizing PyTorch's data loaders

6. **Practical Applications**
    - Applying deep learning models to real-world problems
    - Example projects and case studies
  
## Repo Structure

There are several folders (1 folder = 1 module in course) and in each folder, there are some notebooks that I finished when learning this course.
